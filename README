This is a small program i wrote. It is a daemon that pauses mpd (see package mpd) when a song is finished.

it handle special cases when it does not pauses MPD:
- at beginning
- if song was not finnished (assume next command was issued)
- if mpd was previously in pause

You can control the daemon by sending signals :
SIGINT, SIGQUIT: quit
SIGHUP: toggle pause mode
SIGUSR1: activate pause mode
SIGUSR2: desactivates pause mode

The program does not fork, it's up to you (use disown shell command)
